Abstract = {{In this paper, the effects of altering the organizational setting of
   distributed adaptive search processes in the course of search are
   investigated. We put particular emphasis on the complexity of
   interactions between partial search problems assigned to search agents.
   Employing an agent-based simulation based on the framework of NK
   landscapes we analyze different temporal change modes of the
   organizational set-up. The organizational properties under change
   include, for example, the coordination mechanisms among search agents.
   Results suggest that inducing organizational dynamics has the potential
   to increase the effectiveness of distributed adaptive search processes
   with respect to various performance measures like the final performance
   achieved at the end of the search, the chance to find the optimal
   solution of the search problem, or the average performance per period
   achieved during the search process. However, results also indicate that
   the mode of temporal change in conjunction with the complexity of the
   search problem considerably affects the order of magnitude of these
   beneficial effects. In particular, results suggest that organizational
   dynamics induces a shift towards more exploration, i.e., discovery of
   new areas in the fitness landscape, and less exploitation, i.e.,
   stepwise improvement.}},

Title = {{Product Modularity, Process Modularity, and New Product Introduction
   Performance: Does Complexity Matter?}},
Journal = {{PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Modularity has the potential to impact various facets of new product
   introduction performance including product development lead time,
   frequency of new product introduction, on time introduction and product
   innovation. The impact of modularity on new product introduction
   performance, however, may vary for different levels of product and
   process complexity. This study empirically investigates relationships
   between perceptual measures of product modularity, process modularity,
   and new product introduction performance and explores whether an
   objective product/process complexity measure moderates these
   relationships. Using survey-based methodology we probe both
   manufacturers of technically simple products and technically complex
   products. Hierarchical regression models are used to test hypotheses
   concerning the main effects of product and process modularity and the
   effects of their interactions with complexity on new product
   introduction performance. The results show that the main effect of
   product modularity was positive and its interaction with complexity was
   disordinal and negative, suggesting that the positive effect of product
   modularity on new product introduction performance is dampened when
   complexity is high. For process modularity, only the interaction effect
   (positive) was statistically significant and it was also disordinal in
   nature. Thus, the effect of process modularity on new product
   introduction performance is heightened when complexity is high. The
   implications of these findings are discussed and more specific
   theoretical and managerial implications are delineated by examining the
   impacts of these main and interaction effects on individual measures of
   new product introduction performance (frequency of new product
   introduction, product development lead times, product innovation, and
   on-time product launch).}},

Abstract = {{The aims of the present study were analyze the fatigue process at
   distinct intensity efforts and to investigate its occurrence as
   interactions at distinct body changes during exercise, using complex
   network models. For this, participants were submitted to four different
   running intensities until exhaustion, accomplished in a non-motorized
   treadmill using a tethered system. The intensities were selected
   according to critical power model. Mechanical (force, peak power, mean
   power, velocity and work) and physiological related parameters (heart
   rate, blood lactate, time until peak blood lactate concentration
   (lactate time), lean mass, anaerobic and aerobic capacities) and IPAQ
   score were obtained during exercises and it was used to construction of
   four complex network models. Such models have both, theoretical and
   mathematical value, and enables us to perceive new insights that go
   beyond conventional analysis. From these, we ranked the influences of
   each node at the fatigue process. Our results shows that nodes, links
   and network metrics are sensibility according to increase of efforts
   intensities, been the velocity a key factor to exercise maintenance at
   models/intensities 1 and 2 (higher time efforts) and force and power at
   models 3 and 4, highlighting mechanical variables in the exhaustion
   occurrence and even training prescription applications.}},

Abstract = {{We have considered the complexity and asymptotic stability in the
   process of biochemical substance exchange in a coupled ring of cells. We
   have used coupled maps to model this process. It includes the coupling
   parameter, cell affinity and environmental factor as master parameters
   of the model. We have introduced: (i) the Lempel-Ziv complexity spectrum
   and (ii) the Lempel-Ziv complexity spectrum highest value to analyze the
   dynamics of two cell model. The asymptotic stability of this dynamical
   system using an eigenvalue-based method has been considered. Using these
   complexity measures we have noticed an ``island{''} of low complexity in
   the space of the master parameters for the weak coupling. We have
   explored how stability of the equilibrium of the biochemical substance
   exchange in a multi-cell system (N = 100) is influenced by the changes
   in the master parameters of the model for the weak and strong coupling.
   We have found that in highly chaotic conditions there exists space of
   master parameters for which the process of biochemical substance
   exchange in a coupled ring of cells is stable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The importance of high data quality and the need to consider data
   quality in the context of business processes are well acknowledged.
   Process modeling is mandatory for process-driven data quality
   management, which seeks to improve and sustain data quality by
   redesigning processes that create or modify data. A variety of process
   modeling languages exist, which organizations heterogeneously apply. The
   purpose of this article is to present a context-independent approach to
   integrate data quality into the variety of existing process models. The
   authors aim to improve communication of data quality issues across
   stakeholders while considering process model complexity. They build on a
   keyword-based literature review in 74 IS journals and three conferences,
   reviewing 1,555 articles from 1995 onwards. 26 articles, including 46
   process models, were examined in detail. The literature review reveals
   the need for a context-independent and visible integration of data
   quality into process models. First, the authors present the enhancement
   of existing process models with data quality characteristics. Second,
   they present the integration of a data-quality-centric process model
   with existing process models. Since process models are mainly used for
   communicating processes, they consider the impact of integrating data
   quality and the application of patterns for complexity reduction on the
   models' complexity metrics. There is need for further research on
   complexity metrics to improve the applicability of complexity reduction
   patterns. Lacking knowledge about interdependency between metrics and
   missing complexity metrics impede assessment and prediction of process
   model complexity and thus understandability. Finally, our
   context-independent approach can be used complementarily for data
   quality integration with specific process modeling languages.}},

Abstract = {{For any software project, most experts regard the maintenance phase as
   the most effort and cost intensive of all phases in the software
   development life cycle. This is due to the high maintenance effort,
   time, and resources needed to effectively address issues during software
   maintenance (maintenance activities). Mismanagement of these efforts can
   lead to the degradation of software maintainability. Understanding the
   assessment of the related software processes can help sustain or improve
   maintainability during these maintenance activities. Recent studies have
   shown that current software process assessments are expensive, generic,
   and complex, especially for smaller organizations. In this paper, we
   investigate an alternative software process assessment approach
   performed by analyzing fine-grained processes (micro processes) of
   maintenance activities. This approach assesses maintenance efforts based
   on micro processes in relation to their impact on source code. The
   approach derives maintenance effort from the complexity and duration of
   micro processes and uses proposed metrics based on program slicing to
   measure change impact. In this paper, we investigate an alternative
   software process assessment approach by analysing fine-grained processes
   (micro processes) of maintenance activities. At statistically
   significant levels, results suggest that the level of the maintenance
   efforts correlates with its impact on source code. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{To obtain various underlying data from machining processes, measuring

   complexity is discussed. In order to establish this MSN, first, product
   machining form features, machining components, measuring and sensing
   elements are abstracted as different network nodes. The coupling
   relationships (such as evolving, locating, machining, inspecting and
   monitoring) between different nodes are mapped into network edges. Next,
   a level-by-level evolution model is presented to illustrate the
   formation procedure of establishing MSN. Then, combined with complex
   network theory, the related topological and physical properties are
   defined to analyze the MSN. Finally, a case study is put forward to

Abstract = {{Transparent data flow metrics and control flow metrics had no main
   concern which to be handled by a compiler. Nowadays similar hardware and
   multithreaded coding is increased. Consequently, both data flow and
   control flow become more important in analyses the reusability and
   maintainability. The present analysis of source code and the ability of
   metrics are incompetent to predict the actual amount of information flow
   complexity in the modules. In this work, object oriented metric IF-C
   focuses on the improved information flow complexity estimation method,
   which is used to evaluate the data flows in object oriented source code
   and decrease the effort of maintainability and reusability. The object
   oriented information flow complexity incorporates various internal and
   external flows in object orientation. The adequacy of software metrics
   is validated by the rule accuracy algorithm which is based on rule
   induction technique. The technique applied in the software metrics
   dataset that has been selected using fitness proportionate selection
   algorithm. The competence and efficacy of the software metrics have
   verified by the predefined rules. The rules have if and then clause
   which hold metrics adequacy standards. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Context: Quality assurance of business process models has been
   recognized as an important factor for modeling success at an enterprise
   level. Since quality of models might be subject to different
   interpretations, it should be addressed in the most objective way, by
   the application of measures. That said, however, assessment of
   measurement results is not a straightforward task: it requires the
   identification of relevant threshold values, which are able to
   distinguish different levels of process model quality.
   Objective: Since there is no consensual technique for obtaining these
   values, this paper proposes the definition of thresholds for gateway
   complexity measures based on the application of statistical techniques
   on empirical data.
   Method: To this end, we conducted a controlled experiment that evaluates
   quality characteristics of understandability and modifiability of
   process models in two different runs. The thresholds obtained were
   validated in a replication of the experiment.
   Results: The thresholds for gateway complexity measures are instrumental
   as guidelines for novice modelers. A tool for supporting business
   process model measurement and improvement is described, based on the
   automatic application of measurement, and assessment as well as
   derivation of advice about how to improve the quality of the model.
   Conclusion: It is concluded that thresholds classified business process
   models in the specific level of understandability and modifiability, so
   these thresholds were good and useful for decision-making. (c) 2012

Title = {{Similarity metrics for surgical process models}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-27}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this work is to introduce a set of
   similarity metrics for comparing surgical process models (SPMs). SPMs
   are progression models of surgical interventions that support
   quantitative analyses of surgical activities, supporting systems
   engineering or process optimization.
   Methods and materials: Five different similarity metrics are presented
   and proven. These metrics deal with several dimensions of process
   compliance in surgery, including granularity, content, time, order, and
   frequency of surgical activities. The metrics were experimentally
   validated using 20 clinical data sets each for cataract interventions,
   craniotomy interventions, and supratentorial tumor resections. The
   clinical data sets were controllably modified in simulations, which were
   iterated ten times, resulting in a total of 600 simulated data sets. The
   simulated data sets were subsequently compared to the original data sets
   to empirically assess the predictive validity of the metrics.
   Results: We show that the results of the metrics for the surgical
   process models correlate significantly (p < 0.001) with the induced
   modifications and that all metrics meet predictive validity. The
   clinical use of the metrics was exemplarily, as demonstrated by
   assessment of the learning curves of observers during surgical process
   model acquisition.
   Conclusion: Measuring similarity between surgical processes is a complex
   task. However, metrics for computing the similarity between surgical
   process models are needed in many uses in the field of medical
   engineering. These metrics are essential whenever two SPMs need to be
   compared, such as during the evaluation of technical systems, the
   education of observers, or the determination of surgical strategies.
   These metrics are key figures that provide a solid base for medical
   decisions, such as during validation of sensor systems for use in
   operating rooms in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{As a result of the growing adoption of Business Process Management (BPM)
   technology, different stakeholders need to understand and agree upon the
   process models that are used to configure BPM systems. However, BPM
   users have problems dealing with the complexity of such models.
   Therefore, the challenge is to improve the comprehension of process
   models. While a substantial amount of literature is devoted to this
   topic, there is no overview of the various mechanisms that exist to deal
   with managing complexity in (large) process models. As a result, it is
   hard to obtain an insight into the degree of support offered for
   complexity reducing mechanisms by state-of-the-art languages and tools.
   This paper focuses on complexity reduction mechanisms that affect the
   abstract syntax of a process model, i.e., the formal structure of
   process model elements and their interrelationships. These mechanisms
   are captured as patterns so that they can be described in their most
   general form, in a language-and tool-independent manner. The paper
   concludes with a comparative overview of the degree of support for these
   patterns offered by state-of-the-art languages and tools, and with an
   evaluation of the patterns from a usability perspective, as perceived by
   BPM practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Project complexity is ever growing and needs to be understood, analysed
   and measured better to assist modern project management. The overall
   ambition of this paper is therefore to define a measure of project
   complexity in order to assist decision-making, notably when analysing
   several projects in a portfolio, or when studying different areas of a
   project. A synthesised literature review on existing complexity measures
   is firstly proposed in order to highlight their limitations. Then, we
   identify the multiple aspects of project complexity thanks to the
   construction and refinement of a project complexity framework thanks to
   an international Delphi study. We then propose a multi-criteria approach
   to project complexity evaluation, underlining the benefits of such an
   approach. In order to solve properly this multi-criteria problem, we
   first conduct a critical state of the art on multi-criteria
   methodologies. We then argue for the use of the Analytic Hierarchy
   Process. In the end, this tool permits to define a relative project
   complexity measure, which can notably assist decision-making. Complexity
   scales and subscales are defined in order to highlight the most complex
   alternatives and their principal sources of complexity within the set of
   criteria and sub-criteria which exist in the hierarchical structure.
   Finally, a case study within a start-up firm in the entertainment
   industry (musicals production) is performed. Conclusions, limitations
   and perspectives of research are given in the end. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent advances in 3-D graphics technologies have led to an increasing
   use of processing techniques on 3-D meshes, such as filtering,
   compression, watermarking, simplification, deformation, and so forth.
   Since these processes may modify the visual appearance of the 3-D
   objects, several metrics have been introduced to properly drive or
   evaluate them, from classic geometric ones such as Hausdorff distance,
   to more complex perceptually-based measures. This paper presents a
   survey on existing perceptually-based metrics for visual impairment of
   3-D objects and provides an extensive comparison between them. In
   particular, different scenarios which correspond to different perceptual
   and cognitive mechanisms are analyzed. The objective is twofold: 1)
   catching the behavior of existing measures to help Perception
   researchers for designing new 3-D metrics and 2) providing a comparison
   between them to inform and help computer graphics researchers for
   choosing the most accurate tool for the design and the evaluation of
   their mesh processing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Multinomial processing tree (MPT) modeling is a statistical methodology
   that has been widely and successfully applied for measuring hypothesized
   latent cognitive processes in selected experimental paradigms. This
   paper concerns model complexity of MPT models. Complexity is a key and
   necessary concept to consider in the evaluation and selection of
   quantitative models. A complex model with many parameters often overfits
   data beyond and above the underlying regularities, and therefore, should
   be appropriately penalized. It has been well established and
   demonstrated in multiple studies that in addition to the number of
   parameters, a model's functional form, which refers to the way by which
   parameters are combined in the model equation, can also have significant
   effects on complexity. Given that MPT models vary greatly in their
   functional forms (tree structures and parameter/category assignments),
   it would be of interest to evaluate their effects on complexity.
   Addressing this issue from the minimum description length (MDL)
   viewpoint, we prove a series of propositions concerning various ways in
   which functional form contributes to the complexity of MPT models.
   Computational issues of complexity are also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {{Managing Design-Process Complexity: A Value-of-Information Based

Abstract = {{Design-processes for multiscale, multifunctional systems are inherently
   complex due to the interactions between scales, functional requirements,
   and the resulting design decisions. While complex design-processes that
   consider all interactions lead to better designs, simpler
   design-processes where some interactions are ignored are faster and
   resource efficient. In order to determine the right level of
   simplification of design-processes, designers are faced with the
   following questions: (a) How should complex design-processes be
   simplified without affecting the resulting product performance? (b) How
   can designers quantify and evaluate the appropriateness of different
   design-process alternatives? In this paper, the first question is
   addressed by introducing a method for determining the appropriate level
   of simplification of design-processes-specifically through decoupling of
   scales and decisions in a multiscale problem. The method is based on
   three constructs: interaction patterns to model design-processes,
   intervals to model uncertainty resulting from decoupling of scales and
   decisions, and value-of-information based metrics to measure the impact
   of simplification on the final design outcome. The second question is
   addressed by introducing a value-of-information based metric called the
   improvement potential for quantifying the appropriateness of
   design-process alternatives from the standpoint of product design
   requirements. The metric embodies quantitatively the potential for
   improvement in the achievement of product requirements by adding more
   information for design decision-making. The method is illustrated via a
   datacenter cooling system design example. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.3130791]}},

Abstract = {{Information-theoretic magnitudes measuring randomness (Shannon entropy,
   exponential entropy, power entropy), spread (variance), localization
   (disequilibrium or self-similarity) and intrinsic accuracy (Fisher
   information) are used to compute several measures of complexity
   consisting, each one, of two localization-delocalization factors. These
   proposals have been tested on known, simple, but strongly organized and
   hierarchical systems (atoms) and processes (ionization). A complete
   numerical analysis at the Hartree-Fock level is done in position,
   momentum, and product spaces, where similar trends are followed by all
   studied complexities. It is also found that the complexity planes
   clearly reveal shell-filling patterns across the periodic table.
   Characteristic features accompanying the ionization process are
   identified, and the physical reasons for the observed patterns are
   described. We conclude that (i) the studied complexity measures detect
   not only randomness or localization, but also pattern and organization,
   and (ii) their study is not only Sufficient in the usual position space,
   but also in the complementary momentum space, to have a complete
   description of the information-theoretic behavior of these systems. (C)

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Process modeling languages such as EPCs, BPMN, flow charts, UML activity
   diagrams, Petri nets, etc., are used to model business processes and to
   configure process-aware information systems. It is known that users have
   problems understanding these diagrams. In fact, even process engineers
   and system analysts have difficulties in grasping the dynamics implied
   by a process model. Recent empirical studies show that people make
   numerous errors when modeling complex business processes, e.g., about
   20\% of the EPCs in the SAP reference model have design flaws resulting
   in potential deadlocks, livelocks, etc. It seems obvious that the
   complexity of the model contributes to design errors and a lack of
   understanding. It is not easy to measure complexity, however. This paper
   presents three complexity metrics that have been implemented in the
   process analysis tool ProM. The metrics are defined for a subclass of
   Petri nets named Workflow nets, but the results can easily be applied to
   other languages. To demonstrate the applicability of these metrics, we
   have applied our approach and tool to 262 relatively complex Protos
   models made in the context of various student projects. This allows us
   to validate and compare the different metrics. It turns out that our new
   metric focusing on the structuredness outperforms existing metrics. (C)

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Intrinsic computation refers to how dynamical systems store, structure,
   and transform historical and spatial information. By graphing a measure
   of structural complexity against a measure of randomness,
   complexity-entropy diagrams display the different kinds of intrinsic
   computation across an entire class of systems. Here, we use
   complexity-entropy diagrams to analyze intrinsic computation in a broad
   array of deterministic nonlinear and linear stochastic processes,
   including maps of the interval, cellular automata, and Ising spin
   systems in one and two dimensions, Markov chains, and probabilistic
   minimal finite-state machines. Since complexity-entropy diagrams are a
   function only of observed configurations, they can be used to compare
   systems without reference to system coordinates or parameters. It has
   been known for some time that in special cases complexity-entropy
   diagrams reveal that high degrees of information processing are
   associated with phase transitions in the underlying process space, the
   so-called ``edge of chaos.{''} Generally, though, complexity-entropy
   diagrams differ substantially in character, demonstrating a genuine
   diversity of distinct kinds of intrinsic computation.}},

Abstract = {{Organizations are increasingly faced with the challenge of managing

   important aspect of business processes that has been overlooked is their
   complexity. High complexity in processes may result in poor

   need more time to develop, test, and maintain. Therefore, excessive
   complexity should be avoided Business process measurement is the task of
   empirically and objectively assigning numbers to the properties of
   business processes in such a way so as to describe them. Desirable
   attributes to study and measure include complexity, cost,
   maintainability, and reliability. In our work, we will focus on
   investigating process complexity. We present and describe a metric to
   analyze the control-flow complexity of business processes. The metric is
   evaluated in terms of Weyuker's properties in order to guarantee that it

Abstract = {{Enterprises and service providers are increasingly looking to
   process-based automation as a means of containing and even reducing the
   labor costs of systems management. However, it is often hard to quantify
   and predict the additional complexity introduced by IT service
   management processes before they actually have been deployed. Our
   approach consists in looking at this problem from a different, new
   perspective by regarding complexity as a surrogate for potential labor
   cost and human-error-induced problems: In order to effectively evaluate
   the benefits of IT service management processes-and to target the types
   of processes that contribute most to management complexity and cost-we
   need a set of metrics for quantifying the complexity and human cost of
   carrying out IT service management processes. This paper proposes such
   measures, and demonstrates how they can be applied to a typical service
   delivery process in order to assess its complexity hotspots as a basis
   for process re-engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Complex dynamic systems are wide spread in many industrial sectors such
   as manufacturing systems, queuing systems and supply chain systems. How
   to measure the complexity of dynamic decision processes in a complex
   system is an important issue but yet remains to be solved. In this
   paper, we apply Shannon's entropy as well as other entropic indices to
   measure the complexity of dynamic decision processes, and extend the
   measures for complexity, uncertainty and unpredictability in a Markov
   chain to measure Markov decision processes. We develop a methodology of

Abstract = {{The standard Function Point Analysis (FPA) method maps complexity to an
   ordinal scale such that function types (functions) labelled ``high{''}
   complexity may have a very different underlying complexity. This
   deficiency is the subject of this article. An improved FPA method is
   presented that breaks down a very complex function into an equivalent
   set of functions with normal complexity. The improved FPA method is not
   a new method, it is an improvement of the standard FPA method. In the
   process of defining an improved FPA method, a model was built, which
   helped us find the connection between the standard FPA method and the
   Common Software Measurement International Consortium-Full Function Point
   (COSMIC-FFP) and Mark II Function Point Analysis (MKII FPA) methods.
   These methods were used to define the improved FPA method algorithm,
   because they show a bigger functional size for very complex functions.
   In the end, an evaluation of the improved FPA method was made with the
   results of the ISBSG Repository Data Disk. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Software companies are becoming more and more concerned about software
   process improvement, when they are promoting the improvement of the
   final products. One of the main reason of the growing interest in
   software metrics has been the perception that software metrics are
   necessary for software process improvement. Measurement is essential for
   understanding, defining, managing and controlling the software
   development and maintenance processes and it is not possible to
   characterize the various aspects of development in a quantitative way
   without having a deep understanding of software development activities
   and their relationships. In this paper a representative set of metrics
   for software process models is presented in order to evaluate the
   influence of the software process models complexity in their quality.
   These metrics are focused on the main elements included in a model of
   software processes, and may provide the quantitative base necessary to
   evaluate the changes in the software processes in companies with high
   maturity levels. To demonstrate the practical utility of the metrics
   proposed at model level, an experiment has been achieved which has
   allowed us to obtain some conclusions about the influence of the metrics
   proposed on two sub-characteristics of the maintainability:
   understandability and modifiability, which besides confirm the results

Abstract = {{This paper comprehensively studies assembly process design (APD) to

   chronological steps of APD to a general approach with a view to reduce

   approaches, product and process-based, while exploiting the APD of an
   entire product family. A new evaluation method for measuring the
   complexities of an assembly system at different stages of design has
   been introduced by applying information entropy. The developed
   evaluation methodology explains the available techniques related to
   design, interprets them from a design for variety point of view, and
   leads to techniques to manage complexities in manufacturing. The
   suggested methodology has been applied to examples from automobile part
   manufacturers and has been found to be effective in understanding the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case study which describes the application of
   statistical process performance monitoring and capability assessment on
   a large process control software project. The process performance and
   capability monitoring used in the case study is part of a Quality
   Framework for Software Development (QFSD) devised for the development of
   control systems at Fisher-Rosemount Systems and provides a practical
   alternative to ISO9000 quality models. The process performance
   measurements were based on commonly available metrics that could be
   obtained with the minimum disruption to the processes being examined.
   The application of statistical methods were used to establish problem
   areas at the earliest opportunity allowing process adjustments to be
   made to improve the process performance. The processes used were defined
   in terms of work products which were categorized and evaluated for the
   level of completion. This allowed a process capability to be calculated.
   Those processes which were found to be at a lower capability level
   became the focus for the process improvement for the next project. In
   particular the capability measurement identified processes where
   questions needed to be raised about the relevance of the process,
   whether the techniques used were effective and whether the tools were
   adequate. It was found that achieving high performance and capability is
   a learning process with the development team improving with each new
   project. The benefits have been better managed, more cost and time
   effective projects producing higher quality software. Management and the
   development team have obtained a better understanding of the software
   development process and this continuing learning process has lead to a
   continuous improvement in both the development methodology and the
   resulting software. The paper presents examples of the real benefits
   that can be obtained by tracking process performance and assessing
   process capability at all stages, and shows that this can be achieved
   without the need to resort to complex procedures for process
   measurement, as most of the empirical data came from commonly available
   process data.}},

Abstract = {{In the companion paper, we established a rationale for exploring the
   general principles of dendritic processing using a class of Boolean
   functions-the Multi-Cube Units (MCUs). Here, we use this approach to
   further characterise dendritic processing using ideas from information
   theory and studies in complexity. The starting point is a novel
   decomposition of a Boolean function's total mutual information (between
   input variables and the output). Each component of the decomposition is
   a mutual information measure with respect to a single input, conditioned
   on a subset of the remaining inputs. We call this decomposition the
   information spectrum and conceive of it as a re-representation of the
   function in the information domain. Furthermore, the information
   spectrum of a Boolean function may be assigned a complexity value using
   the approximate entropy introduced by Pincus (Pincus, S. M. (1991).
   Approximate entropy as a measure of system complexity. Proc. Natl, Acad.
   Sci. USA, 88, 2297-2301). Using Monte Carlo methods, we provide evidence
   that the information spectral complexity of MCUs is larger than that of
   any other class of Boolean function. We explain this phenomenon in terms
   of information flow through the 2-stage MCU architecture. Under our
   modelling assumptions, the implication for biological neural processing
   is that dendrites implement functions that have maximal information
   spectral complexity with respect to the class of multivariate functions
   from which they are drawn. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Our main aim is to propose a new characterization for the software
   development process. We suggest that software development methodology
   has some limits. These limits are a clue that software development
   process is more subjective and empirical than objective and formal. We
   use Kolmogorov complexity to develop the formal argument and to outline
   the informal conclusions. Kolmogorov complexity is based on the size in
   bits of the smallest effective description of an object and is a
   suitable quantitative measure of the object's information content. We
   try to show that notion of complexity is a suitable measure and a tool
   for the characterization of the software development process. Following
   the paper conclusions, the limits of formal methods typifies the
   software development process as experimental and heuristical based,
   like, for example, the scientific development in physics and chemistry.
   Moreover, by our approach, we argue that software development is, in
   some sense, formally unpredictable. These conclusions suggest that
   software engineering is a scientific field not totally characterized by
   the typical work of engineering, but also by the experimental sciences
   methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a complexity analysis of mutual information transmission of EEC
   developed by us {[}Xu J, Liu Z, Liu R, Yang Q (1997) Physica D 106:
   363-374]. dynamic processes of the complexity of mutual information
   transmission in human brains were studied. To diminish possible problems
   due to coarse graining preprocessing, some new measures of complexity
   were used. The results show that, just before and after generalized
   seizures, the complexities of almost all information transmission
   between different brain areas drop significantly; there is also a
   temporary decrease of complexity when subjects shift their attention.
   The above facts suggest that there is a transient decrease of
   information transmission complexity when brain state changes occur
   suddenly. Mental arithmetic tasks activate the left temporal lobe to
   exchange more information with other brain areas. The results hint that
   the methods used here might be an approach to observe quick processes in
   the living brain.}},

Abstract = {{The shape complexity of two-dimensional (2D) polygonal spatial objects
   has implications for how the object can be best represented in a spatial
   database, and for the query-processing performance of that object.
   Nevertheless few useful definitions of query-processing relevant spatial
   complexity are available, A query-processing oriented shape complexity
   measure is likely to be different from a fractal measure of shape
   complexity that focused on compression/decompression or a shape
   complexity measure that would be used fur pattern recognition, and
   should give better performance for the analysis of query processing. It
   could be used to classify spatial objects, cluster spatial objects in
   multiprocessor database systems. In a recent paper Brinkhoff et al. (T.
   Brinkhoff, H-P. Kriegel, R. Shneider, A. Braun, Measuring the complexity
   of spatial objects, Proceedings of the 3rd ACM International Workshop on
   Advances in Geographic Information Systems, Baltimore, MD, 1995, pp.
   109-117) demonstrated the usefulness of a spatial complexity measure.
   They did not however, offer much theoretical justification for their
   choice of parameters nor for the functional form that they used. In this
   paper we present a conceptual framework for discussing the query
   processing oriented shape complexity measures for spatial objects. It is
   hoped that this will lead to the development of improved measures of
   spatial complexity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the average time complexity of evaluating all prefixes of an
   input vector over a given algebraic structure {[}Sigma, x]. As a
   computational model networks of finite controls are used and a
   complexity measure for the average delay of suck networks is introduced.
   Based on this notion, we then define the average case complexity of a
   computational problem for arbitrary strictly positive input
   distributions. We give a complete characterization of the average
   complexity of prefix functions with respect to the underlying algebraic
   structure {[}Sigma, x] resp. the corresponding Moore-machine M. By
   considering a related reachability problem for finite automata it is
   shown that the complexity only depends on two properties of M, called
   confluence and diffluence. We prove optimal lower bounds for the average
   case complexity. Furthermore, a network design is presented that
   achieves the optimal delay for all prefix functions and all inputs of a
   given length while keeping the network size linear. It differs
   substantially from the known constructions for the worst case.}},
