abstract = "Recent research has shown that business process models from practice suffer from several quality problems. In particular, the correctness of control flow has been analyzed for industry-scale collections of process models revealing that error ratios are surprisingly high. In the past the structuredness property has been discussed as a guideline to avoid errors, first in research on programming, and later also in business process modeling. In this paper we investigate the importance of structuredness for process model correctness from an empirical perspective. We introduce definitions of two metrics that quantify the (un)structuredness of a process model, the degree of structuredness and the unmatched connector count. Then, we use the event-driven process chain models of the SAP reference model for validating the capability of these metrics to predict error probability. Our findings clearly support the importance of structuredness as a design principle for achieving correctness in process models.",

abstract = "Analysing conceptual models is a frequent task of business process management (BPM), for instance to support comparison or integration of business processes, to check business processes for compliance or weaknesses, or to tailor conceptual models for different audiences. As recently, many companies have started to maintain large model collections and analysing such collections manually may be laborious, practitioners have articulated a demand for automatic model analysis support. Hence, BPM scholars have proposed a plethora of different model analysis techniques. As virtually any conceptual model can be interpreted as a mathematical graph and model analysis techniques often include some kind of graph problem, in this paper, we introduce a graph algorithm based model analysis framework that can be accessed by specialized model analysis techniques. To prove that basic graph algorithms are feasible to support such a framework, we conduct a performance analysis of selected graph algorithms.",

The model migration problem---migration of UML activity diagrams from version 1.4 to version 2.2---is non-trivial and practically relevant. The solutions have been compared with respect to several criteria: correctness, conciseness, understandability, appropriateness, maturity and support for extensions to the core migration task. We describe in detail the comparison method, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the solutions with a special focus on the differences between graph and model transformation for model migration. The comparison results demonstrate tool and language features that strongly impact the efficacy of solutions, such as support for retyping of model elements. The results are used to motivate an agenda for future model migration research (including suggestions for areas in which the tools need to be further improved).",

Quality assurance of business process models should be addressed in the most objective manner, e.g., through the application of measures, but the assessment of measurement results is not a straightforward task and it requires the identification of relevant indicators and threshold values, which are able to distinguish different levels of process model quality. Furthermore, indicators must support the improvements of the models by using suitable guidelines. In this paper, we present a case study to evaluate the BPMIMA framework for BP model improvement. This framework is composed of empirically validated measures related to quality characteristics of the models, a set of indicators with validated thresholds associated with modeling guidelines and a prototype supporting tool. The obtained data suggest that the redesign by applying guidelines driven by the indicator results was successful, as the understandability and modifiability of the models were improved. In addition, the changes in the models according to guidelines were perceived as acceptable by the practitioners who participated in the case study.},

abstract = "BPEL processes are workflow-oriented composite services for service-oriented solutions. Rapidly changing environment and turbulent market conditions require flexible BPEL processes to adapt with several modifications during their life cycles. Such adaptability and flexibility require the low degree of dependency or coupling between a BPEL process and its surrounding environment. In fact, heavy coupling and context dependency with partners provoke several undesirable drawbacks such as poor understandability, inflexibility, inadaptability, and defects. This paper is to propose metrics at the design phase to measure BPEL process context independency. With the aid of these metrics, the architect could analyze and control the context independency of a BPEL process quantitatively. To validate the metrics, authors collected a data set consisting 70 BPEL processes and also gathered the expert's rating of context independency through conducting a controlled experiment. The obtained results reveal that there exists a high statistical correlation between the proposed metrics and the expert's judgment of context independency.",

abstract = "This paper addresses the issue of improving quality of business process (BP) models by exploiting domain knowledge. Indeed, business process models reflect the business processes of companies. The success of these processes has a direct and undeniable impact on business operations success. Managing them through their underlying models helps improving their effectiveness, consistency, and transparency. BP modeling aims at a better understanding of processes, allowing deciders to achieve strategic goals of the company. However, several studies from the literature showed that in experienced system analysts often produce low-level quality. This situation is partly due to lack of domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to support this modeling effort with an approach that uses domain knowledge to improve the semantic quality of BP models. We suggest to use ontologies as a mean to capture domain knowledge and meta-modeling techniques to deal with BP models independently of languages in which they are expressed. Our contribution is threefold: (1) the meta-models describing both a domain ontology and a BP model are described, (2) the alignment between the concepts of both meta-models is defined and illustrated, (3) a set of Object Constraint Language mapping rules is provided. A simple case study illustrates the process.",
